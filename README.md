# StackOverflowHCA

This code hits the StackOverflow Api and displays in tableview results that have
1. an accepted answer
2. more than 1 answer

The "apiString" is the endpoint hit:
"https://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/questions/featured?order=desc&sort=activity&site=stackoverflow" gets a list of featured questions, but
code will work with an questions returned
